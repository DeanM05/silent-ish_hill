We never dreamed we would make it this far, but with my appointment as the editor of the Lake Belview Bulletin, my new salary can finally pay for us to get a place of our own.

[[Continue-&gt;The Drive.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="The Drive." tags="Act-1" position="300,0">We have to move most of our belongings from further up-state, and the drive has been fairly uneventful so far. Lily is fast asleep in the back of the car. She&#x27;s three years old, and already she&#x27;s getting lost in stories about fairies and princesses. She was reading one of the books that Jean got her for her birthday last month. 

[[Continue-&gt;Too Late.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Too Late." tags="Act-1" position="450,0">Jean tried to get my attention, but she was too late. I was lost in my own thoughts. I couldn&#x27;t see the lights ahead of me turn red.

Your whole body feels numb and weak, and you barely understand the situation you&#x27;re in. You smell smoke and turn around to see your car has ended up straight in the rear of the movers&#x27; truck ahead of you. There is no sign of Jean or Lily anywhere.

[[Check inside the car.]]
[[Ask the driver of the movers&#x27; truck where they&#x27;re gone.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Check inside the car." tags="Act-1" position="825,150">The inside of the car is a mess. Lily&#x27;s book is in the passenger seat, and the belt on her high chair is open. There is no sign of Lily or Jean.

It could have been days, or it could have been minutes. You wake up, and find yourself in a hospital bed. There&#x27;s a note beside you, in hastily scribbled cursive.
&quot;Your daughter is in surgery, call a nurse if you wake up before we come and check on you again.&quot;

[[Call for a nurse.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Call for a nurse." tags="" position="750,300">There&#x27;s no answer from outside, and no signs of any movement or sound. It seems to be getting dark. As you look out the window you see a light fog has found its way here, blanketing the cold snow ridden ground, as the sun is about to set.

There&#x27;s a brief flash of a silhouette outside the door. You get up to go check what it was and find that you&#x27;re hooked up to a drip.

Calling for a nurse, again there is no reply.

[[Remove the drip and go take a look around.]]
[[Wait just a little bit longer.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Remove the drip and go take a look around." tags="" position="600,225">The figure you saw moving by the door stands at the end of the hall, as if they are waiting for you. It&#x27;s a woman in a hospital gown. She turns around and you see that it&#x27;s Jean.

Shouting after her, she looks frightened, and turns to run down another corridor, seemingly scared of something.

[[Go after Jean.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Wait just a little bit longer." tags="" position="600,375">After waiting for another 15 minutes, there&#x27;s still no sign of any movement. You finally get up and peer out into the hallway. The figure that moved outside of the door before is nowhere to be seen. 

Standing out in the hallway, you hear a noise behind the closest corner.

[[Check it out.-&gt;Go after Jean.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Go after Jean." tags="" position="450,300">You come around the corner and find Lily wandering the halls of the hospital by herself.

&quot;Lily! Thank God you&#x27;re alright!&quot; you exclaim with relief.

We need to find Mommy!&quot; shouts Lily, woefully. Lily looks severely distressed, her cheeks glistening with half-dried tears, fresh ones gathering up in her terrified eyes to follow suit. She shakily waves her hand for you to follow.

[[Follow Lily.]]
[[&quot;We&#x27;ll find her, Lily, but follow me now.&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Follow Lily." tags="" position="225,450">Lily starts running down the hallway, seemingly taking turns aimlessly without looking at any signs. You run after her.

[[Look around the hospital in search of people.]]
[[Find an exit.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Look around the hospital in search of people." tags="" position="300,600">You explore most of the hospital, but there&#x27;s nobody to be found. Everything looks totally normal, except for the fact that you&#x27;re alone.

[[Find an exit.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Find an exit." tags="" position="450,600">You follow a few signs that lead you to the waiting area, where there is a door to the outside.

There&#x27;s been a huge accident. The people have all disappeared. I&#x27;ve been stuck here now for two weeks, visiting you every day in the hospital.

That they only brought in two people from the accident.

If you do find Lily make sure to protect her. Don&#x27;t let her out of your sight. I&#x27;m going to look for a way out of this town, but every time I do, I seem to get lost. I never did have your sense of direction. 

I&#x27;ll be coming back to the hospital to check on you, and I&#x27;m leaving this here in case I&#x27;m not around when you wake up.

Please wait here for me. If I don&#x27;t come back then promise me you won&#x27;t let anything happen to Lily.
